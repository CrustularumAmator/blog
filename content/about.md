During my undergraduate studies at the [UW Paul G. Allen School of CSE](https://www.cs.washington.edu) (while not being busy with minoring in diversity and math), I explored teaching and research assistant opportunities.  


Since then, I have developed a strong interest in ML-driven infrastructure, high-performance pipelines, inference, and distributed training.  


Beyond academics and side projects, I contribute to spacecraft communication software at the [Husky Satellite Lab (HSL)](https://huskysat.aa.washington.edu) and mentor students through the [Software Engineering Career Club (SWECC)](https://swecc.org).  


Additionally, I advise [CSEED](https://cseed.co), a student-led incubator supporting early-stage startups, which aligns with my passion for bootstrapping innovation.  


I also contribute to open-source projects ([ML flow](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow), [Cilium](https://github.com/cilium/cilium), etc) and enjoy collaborating on tools and initiatives that advance systems and software development.
